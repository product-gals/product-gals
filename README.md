## Hi, I'm Meagan 👋
I'm a Product Manager who actually builds. After years of leading PLG transformations at early-stage B2B SaaS companies, I'm excited by AI, so I started shipping code too.

🛠️ What I'm Building
---
🗂️ Prodfolio
A portfolio platform built for Product Managers, because PMs deserve a way to show their work that doesn't require a design degree or a dev team. Built as the solo technical founder using AI-assisted development.

🐾 Remember My Pet
A memorial platform to celebrate the pets we've loved and lost.

📈 What I Do as a PM
---
I specialize in helping early-stage B2B + B2B SaaS companies transitioning from sales-led to product-led growth. I've led hundreds of UX interviews, driven a 92% increase in activation, and generated a 14% increase in revenue through PLG transformations.

Status: Open to Senior PM roles + fractional engagements
Focused on: PLG, activation, growth, or early-stage SaaS. Special interest will be taken in the travel or fitness space regardless of stage.
